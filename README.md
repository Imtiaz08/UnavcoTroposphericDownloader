# UnavcoTroposphericDownloader
A simple MATLAB scrip that finds the tropospheric data on the Unavco

Note: The script works on MATLAB v2017 and above. 

I will be adding more features to this script with the passage of time and will make it a complete swiss army knife for researchers. Data collection is always a daunting task for some people. Especially those who are just starting up waste a lot of time getting looking for data collection sources. This script will help them get tropospheric data for GNSS based research and analysis of the troposphere. 

In the next updates, I will add Total Electron Content (TEC) data collection from various sources and IGS stations. Furthermore, I am also planning to add a section which will allow users to download precise GNSS orbit and clock data i.e. SP3 files and .CLK files for precise positioning and timing. 

Thank you so much for taking your time.
